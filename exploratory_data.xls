2010-02-06,More Dallas ASE Information,"The start time for Tuesday morning has been changed from 9am to 8am.  
Breakfast will be served at 7:30.  Therefore, shuttle pick up times at the 
hotel for Tuesday morning have been changed to 7:10, 7:25, and 7:40 am.  
Again, the last shuttle is not recommended if you intend to have breakfast at 
the ASE.

Some of you had asked about a coordinated dinner for Sunday night.  Since 
arrival times into Dallas vary greatly, we are leaving you to your own 
devices for Sunday night.  We are however, planning a group dinner for Monday 
night after we wrap up for the day.  We will arrange transportation from the 
ASE to the restaurant and from the restaurant back to the hotel.  Currently, 
Monday's agenda shows a completion time of 6:30pm.  Therefore, we are 
planning to head to dinner directly from the ASE without a break or trip back 
to the hotel.

2011-10-15,Re: Visit,"Hey Aunt Bonnie,

I thoroughly enjoyed your visit as well.  It has been too long since the last 
time we got together.  I hope that we get to see more of each other in the 
coming years.   Hopefully, we can make a trip up to Pennsylvania soon.

Love,

Eric

2011-05-18,RAC risk reporting,"Currently, members of Ted Murphy's group have been preparing certain 
non-standard reports at the request of commercial.  These reports can be 
categorized as:

""morning report"" - daily
Component V@R - daily
Adhoc V@R - as needed
Book reconciliation - as needed
Stress testing - as needed
Back testing - weekly
Correlation Matrix - bi-weekly


I have obtained a copy of all reports currently being prepared.  In the 
upcoming weeks we need to transfer the preparation of these reports from RAC 
to Risk Operations.  In order to do that, on a report by report basis, we 
need to determine what group within Risk Operations should prepare these 
reports (Risk Management and Controls or the individual commodity risk 
management groups).

In the next couple days,  I will be sending you each a listing of reports 
prepared, and then set up a time to meet with you so we can determine the 
best way to go forward.

set a deadline of November 10th to have a plan on all North American projects 
(I'm ok if fundementals groups are excluded) that is signed off on by 
commercial, Sally's world, and Beth's world.  When I say signed off I mean 
that I want signitures on a piece of paper that everyone is onside with the 
plan for each project.  If you don't agree don't sign. If certain projects 
(ie. the gas plan) are not done yet then lay out a timeframe that the plan 
will be complete.  I want much more in the way of specifics about objectives 
and timeframe.

Thanks for everyone's hard work on this.

2011-03-07,Internet E-mail,"
In an effort to protect Enron's e-mail system from harmful viruses, the Global Messaging Team has implemented an inbound and outbound cluster of MAILSweeper servers. What does that mean to you, the user? All inbound and outbound Internet mail is passed through a set of servers that will scan each message for viruses, malicious code, business related-content and inappropriate content. Inbound Internet mail that contains the following attachment types will be quarantined (held for delivery): *.vbs, *.exe, *.com, *.bat, *.cmd. If you are the intended recipient of one of these e-mails, you will receive an automatic notification with instructions on how to get your legitimate e-mail released from quarantine.

We have taken these measures to protect our e-mail environment from harmful e-mail viruses. We believe that these protections will result in less down time for your e-mail, in the event that Enron gets hit with a virus or malicious code.",sally.beck@enron.com,0.1636941,0.6382487,0.19805726,neutral,2011-03-07/2011-03-13,0.034363160000000004,0.027994059718298197,0.10857199566666663,0.16731425437869363,0.6545265879979252,-1.4999999999999998,0.1095135414007828,0.26497049778000004,0.3309283025079342,1.0247155535950385,-0.3992097406123025,0.2443285962281125,0.06194640112857143,0.4942960613115509,-0.4275571405034673,0.18611861886022396,0.2200936240987833,0.14241033236,0.4691413689910359,-0.37592301477166934,0.4171470779364048,0.16613733916114887,0.10483652116999999,0.40759948375966926,-0.2265614141953599,1.0770574888355036,2011-03-07,2,0,0,0.300155688,-0.008802860999999995,0.18443942000000002,2011-03,0

must contribute and be aware of keeping all the books flat.  Day shift should 
have all their positions flat and if not flat, you need to leave the night 
shift with proper information so that they can flatten out the position.  
Night shift should run the scheduling activity report for each region and 
make sure that every book is flat by 6:00 a.m.  AGAIN THERE ARE NO EXCUSES.

write me a check for $100.  I will pay the $1252.  

You will pay me $100/ month for 13 months ( so you last payment will be made 
to me on October 18th, 2001).
Payments will be due to me on the 18th of every month - NO EXCEPTIONS -  I 
cannot do this deal if you do not pay me on time - I will not make any 
exceptions for you.

Let me know if this is ok with you and I will work up a contract.

I will look forward to seeing you there. 

Will you be in Dallas next week for the ASE?  I will be there.  I did let 
Melissa know when the dates were announced that I will quietly slip out about 
mid afternoon on Thursday.  Amanda's school open house is Thursday at 7:00, 
and parents will follow their children's schedules and meet all of the 
teachers.  With this being Amanda's   first year in junior high, it is 
important for me to meet the teachers and understand their expectations so

2011-03-10,CG&E Agreements,"JD,

To follow up on our earlier meeting, attached are the following documents for CG&E:

	- TSA network handbook which summarizes all requirements
	- Request for Network Transmission Service (Network Application)
	- Request to designate a New Network Resource (only required when we are ready to designate a resource)
	- OATT Tariff Attachments that includes Attachment F, Network Service Agreement and Attachment G, Network Operating Agreement
	- CG&E TSA, Transmission Scheduling Agent Agreement

If EPMI does not already have the Network Transmission Agreements in place, then CG&E indicated that the process was to first fill out the Network Application and then they will send the Network Service Agreement and the Network Operating Agreement.  

My contacts at CG&E have been Paul Jett  (513) 287-1770 and Steve Averbeck (513) 287-2876.  The government affairs contact is Gloria Ogenyi x 58202.  

Thanks, 
Jeff

2010-12-18,Restaurant Name,"The name of the restaurant that I liked for lunch was Christophers.  It is at 
Victoria Station, or in the lobby of what was or is a hotel at Victoria 
Station.  Quick walk from the office.  Apparently, there is another location 
at Covent Gardens.  

Dinner last night was fun.  It is always great to see you either in Houston 
or London.  Sorry that our goodbye was so abrupt.  I think that the taxi 
driver was afraid that we would get him killed!  I called home last night and 
told Amanda about our discussion on a day in Paris.  She is ready!!

Let us know when you will next be in Houston.  I should be here quarterly - 
probably head back in March or April.  --Sally ",bobette.riner@ipgdirect.com,0.07615149,0.3247332,0.5991153,positive,2010-12-13/2010-12-19,0.52296381,0.07355132820398745,0.21892547546666666,0.27120348117969917,0.5288895465646565,-1.5000000000000002,0.17507570287637023,0.4881309871799999,0.4184204857274202,-0.0637455831122243,-1.627028025957771,0.33007150910071087,0.2699732961285714,0.5745185019655249,-0.534189837682514,-0.48957409907000793,0.2616013916630138,0.33944412289,0.5114698345582208,-0.7693843901206054,0.015013178321771736,0.21111528428896525,0.18641101253666664,0.45947283302602915,0.06916710228247751,-0.5764824725620863,2010-12-18,6,5,1,0.1318820464,0.0019305700000000064,0.8224299079999999,2010-12,1

2011-06-26,Fortune Article,"On Sunday, the new Fortune magazine was a roadway for my two-year old's 
cars.  On Monday, my sixteen year-old used the cover to cut out pictures of 
money for a school project.  Last night, the magazine made it into my hands 
around midnight when everything at home was settled in for the night.  What a 
nice article!  I smiled while reading it.  How nice to see your 
accomplishments recognized in print.  Congratulations.  I hope that you have 
plenty of copies for your mom and dad.  --Sally ",eric.bass@enron.com,0.002125189,0.019131672,0.97874314,positive,2011-06-20/2011-06-26,0.9766179509999999,0.35302950374499753,0.2906822516666666,0.5941628596142623,0.705767036508451,-1.5000000000000002,0.19603783329369773,0.30537852228,0.4427615987116517,0.6945609630323315,-1.0556701822096415,0.18950934457074917,0.33589329848571425,0.4353267101508351,0.48374190030149283,-1.453464681113643,0.29859874109524054,0.27618598279,0.5464418917828688,-0.2348371584578381,-0.6665908581460571,0.21795244046276738,0.20458652740333333,0.4668537677504246,0.13217146007548936,-0.5597658218226789,2011-06-26,1,6,1,-0.06447846600000001,-0.04009272999999999,0.52296381,2011-06,1

2010-10-14,New Stock Symbol,"
Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol ""ENRNQ.""  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC ""Pink Sheets.""

PECO) that they were going to do away with verbal check-outs.  PECO has 
created a web-based system that will allow counterparties to check-out 
on-line.  He asked that we go into their website and register EPMI as one of 
PECO's counterparties;  this will give us access to their online-checkout 
system.  The url is www.exeloncorp.com.........  Go to PowerTeam then Tie Out 
to sign up.....  Let me know if you need me to go through the sign-up process 
myself or if one of you guys wants to take care of it...

2010-08-20,CG&E Agreements,"JD,

To follow up on our earlier meeting, attached are the following documents for CG&E:

	- TSA network handbook which summarizes all requirements
	- Request for Network Transmission Service (Network Application)
	- Request to designate a New Network Resource (only required when we are ready to designate a resource)
	- OATT Tariff Attachments that includes Attachment F, Network Service Agreement and Attachment G, Network Operating Agreement
	- CG&E TSA, Transmission Scheduling Agent Agreement

If EPMI does not already have the Network Transmission Agreements in place, then CG&E indicated that the process was to first fill out the Network Application and then they will send the Network Service Agreement and the Network Operating Agreement.  

My contacts at CG&E have been Paul Jett  (513) 287-1770 and Steve Averbeck (513) 287-2876.  The government affairs contact is Gloria Ogenyi x 58202.  

Thanks, 
Jeff

money!

Here are some pictures from the first roll of film - Emily was about 5 or 6 
days old.  She brings me joy I never thought possible.  And I'm sure some day 
she'll bring me some pain, but I'm not thinking about that right now.  I 
didn't know how easy it was to fall in love.  I am a different person 
(better) because of her.  
Yesterday, we made our first trip to the pediatrician and he said that she 
was doing fine.  She gained  7 ounces!  She's quite a good little eater.  We 
are settling into a routine and she sleeps about 4 hours at a time so it 
gives me time to get a fair amount of rest.  We'll probably make a trip down 
to the EB in a few weeks and I'll be sure to let you know exactly when.  I 
hope you all are doing well -- stay in touch.  Here's the pictures.....(by 
the way, the blonde at the hospital with me is my youngest sister, Kerri)

2011-11-13,Re: Do you want to reschedule a catch up ?,"Tried you this morning from the car and missed you.  Do you want to talk 
Thursday morning during my commute?  I will be out of the office Friday, 
March 2 and Monday, March 5.  I will be a chaperone for my daughter's high 
school drill team to state competition in Dallas - really a Texas 
experience!  A great time to support her and be around her friends.   And 
nicely enough, she asked me to be a chaperone.  With 81 girls on the team, it 
will be loud, but fun.  --Sally

2010-05-30,Re: Got caught up with real time issue - missed my slot today,"I was probably hopelessly stuck in traffic when we were to talk, and did not 
even realize that the time had passed. Construction on my route in to work is 
to continue until early January, and my alternate routes have proven to 
busts.  

I will call you tomorrow and see if I can catch you between issues.

Thanks for making the trip to Houston with your crew last week.  It was great 
to have people from so many different offices, supporting so many different 
commodities -- and yet with so many similar issues.  Your support for the 
interaction between offices is so valuable.  Thanks again for all of your 
efforts.  --Sally

2011-05-30,OU Salaries,"Sally,

Just something from a recruiting prospective for us to think about, 
remembering the situation from last fall of George making the mistake of 
extending verbal offers, quoting incorrect salaries, and the difference being 
recovered by your RC, I wanted to bring the potential of a residual OU salary 
issue to your attention.  

The salary being offered for another internship or full-time position, which 
ever applies, may appear (to the OU candidates) to be wrong.  Interns will 
enter the program at the same pay rate, $3,000 monthly and the full-time 
analysts at 40k.  As you know, both salaries are non-negotiable for 
consistency amongst the program participants.  

I'm sure questions will come up regarding compensation and thought we could 
discuss the inevitable.  I would really like your input on how to ""soften the 
blow"".

I look forward to your response.
Thanks

2011-10-04,Potential employment opportunities with Enron,"Dear Mr. Arnold:

I was referred to you by Ms. Eva Pao.  I am a second year MBA student at
Harvard Business School, writing to express interest in exploring potential
employment opportunities with Enron.  In particularly, I am interested in
derivatives trading.

I have attached my resume for your convenience. As you can see, my
professional experience has been in a variety of roles within financial
institutions and specifically, managing a currency trading-desk, before
starting my MBA.

I would appreciate an opportunity to meet with you or with one of your
colleagues, on a formal or informal basis, who might be in the Boston or NYC
areas in the next few months.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Gad Caspy

2010-03-28,Transmission Rates,"Hey guys,

I've updated the transmission rates table for May - here is the location:

M:ElectricEast Volume MgmtTransmissionTransmission Rates

If there is a better spot for this to make it more accessible just let me 
know and I can put a copy of it whereever.

Couple of other trends I've noticed that hopefully can be corrected...

First Energy transmission is now and has been for a while under the 
counterparty American Transmission Systems, Inc. (ATSI)
Duke transmission should be under the Duke counterparty Duke Electric 
Transmission (DUKEELETRA)
Georgia's ancillary service charges have changed although their website has 
not be updated - price changed from $2.57 to $2.49

Please pass this along to the rest of the group, if any of you have any 
questions or suggestions - don't hesitate to call.

Thanks,
Michael

2010-10-13,National Grid as Managing member of ARTO,"On May 15, 2001, National Grid filed a petition for declatory order in Docket No. EL01-80 asking the FERC to find that it is not a ""market participant"" with respect to the ARTO region in order that it can seek to become the Managing Member of the Alliance RTO.  The filing was noticed and comments/protests are due June 14, 2001.

National Grid, a company that operates in New England, claims that it retains only insignificant generation assets and wholesale marketing operations in regions remote from the Alliance region (i.e. New England and New York after the NIMO merger is completed).  It has minor ""last resort"" sales obligations which they expect to terminate by 2005.  National Grid will not be providing ancillary services to the ARTO region.

get the message from Tammy.  Lots of catch up in the office last week, which 
will continue this week.  I think that Chris is home by now, and I am sure 
that you and Erica are glad to have the additional company.  We are starting 
to talk birthday with Meagan now.  I will get back with you in a couple of 
days after Meg and I have gone through the JA catalogue.  Thanks for asking.

Regarding the employment agreement, Mike declined without a counter.  Keith 
said he would sign for $75K cash/$250 equity.  I still believe Frank should

prudency policy in line with that of North America.  In response to these 
pressures, we have conducted a thorough review of our prudency policy and 
have determined that all discretionary prudency and general reserves 
(including VAR based prudency) should be eliminated. Deal specific prudency 
will, however, remain. In order to avoid any arguments with AA near the 
quarter end the release to the London summary DPR should happen today for the 
August month end.

Apologies for the short notice but the final decision was only made very 
recently. Please pass this message around to those people in your groups who 
are not on the above mail list so that 'everyone' is aware of the change.

If there are any questions please let me know.

2010-09-22,We Got the Money!!,"
As I alluded to in my note yesterday, Enron has received a commitment for $1 billion in additional credit from our agent banks. This is great news, more from a market perception standpoint than an actual cash need. You can be assured that senior management is totally focused on the need to shore up the balance sheet with additional equity, now that we have the debt in place, but the equity we be a longer process.

In the meantime, lets get back to work. I would encourage people to talk to their supervisors about this situation if you feel ""angst"".

2010-08-10,*Updated* Nightly Duties and MDEA Load sheets folder,"Hello all,

Attached is an updated sheet regarding what needs to be done at night regarding MDEA and our old nightly duties. 

Also there is now a folder near the MAPP printer (between Dean and Don) that will include all the nightly faxes and load sheets.  The folder will help us keep track of what has been faxed in case EES trans calls complaining.  The load sheets are needed for the daily forecasting expained in the SOP 13 Dean sent out last week. In the folder there are extra copies of the SOP 13 in case you want it as well as GENCO phone numbers in case Allegheny calls. 

Hopefully this will help create some consistency on nights and provide the day people access to the MDEA load sheets.  If you have any questions please give me a ring.

Happy Holidays,

Carrie

2010-03-12,Action from last Doorstep meeting,"Ted / Sally 

We took as an action from the last meeting the need to re-authorise all 
traders within the metals global businesses, sign this list off with the 
EnronMetals Managing Directors and accompany this list with a note 
highlighting the dangers of non authorised trading activity.

Due to the storm here yesterday we had to delay the operational control 
meeting with the MDs until today and therefore hope to have this out tomorrow 
with effect from COB 31 st.

Apologies for the delay - any issues please call

2011-06-06,RE: TradersNews,"Don,
I got a call from another Hourly Trading floor that uses Enron online and is
looking to do some hourly deals at Cinergy.
He said he has not seen anything for over a month.  Do you think you guys
will put the TNE numbers back up, or if they are where should he be looking.

How was Vegas?

2011-01-23,(No Subject),"Jacques,

I think we reached an agreement with George and Larry to pick up the items of 
value and not pay any fees for their time.  It looks as if we will be able to 
use everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey, 
appraisal).  One point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 in 
extensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land like 
earnest money would be applied.  I looked at the closing statements and I 
didn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price.  Can you help clear 
this up.

Assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released.  
Keith and I are concerned about taking over the Bishop Corner partnership and 
the risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities.  On the other hand, 
conveyance of the partnership would be a time and money saver if it was 
clean.  What is your inclination?

Call as soon as you have a chance to review.

2010-11-18,So long,"Hey y'all,

as most of you would probably know by now, I have chosen to leave Enron to
pursue other opportunities.  It's been a good time (4+ years) with great
experiences both in North/South America and in Europe.

I'd like to use this e-mail to thank everybody for their good work and
friendship.  In particular (in order of appearance): Dung Tran, Jon Doyle,
Dave Ramm, Natalie Halich, Roberto Silveira and Rick Waddell have been great
sources of learning and leadership.

'Other opportunities' means exactly that - not quite sure what the next
adventure will be, but it won't be boring!  I encourage you to reply with
your personal e-mail etc., so that we can keep in touch.

All the best,
Christian

I talked with Peggy this morning. We want to get all the facts and
stipulations laid out for the grant. This will keep any falsehoods from being
spread. We want to encourage all residents to express their feelings, but we
need good facts. It is our intent to get all the facts and try to make this a
positive thing for our residents.

The city has always been very good about working with us and we appreciate it.

2010-04-21,Re:,"Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.  
Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding 
the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business 
meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is 
even desired or necessary.

As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try 
and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working 
and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet 
just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a 
round table discussion format.  

My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and 
jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.

purchase the land at the back of CCV:

I talked with Peggy this morning. We want to get all the facts and
stipulations laid out for the grant. This will keep any falsehoods from being
spread. We want to encourage all residents to express their feelings, but we
need good facts. It is our intent to get all the facts and try to make this a
positive thing for our residents.

The city has always been very good about working with us and we appreciate it.

As many of you know, we will have a group of 58 OU JCPenney Leadership 
students and 10 Texas A&M Fellows students come to Enron Friday afternoon for 
a Corporate View.

I have attached a copy of the agenda for the afternoon and still need 8-10 
volunteers for lunch.  Please let me know if you can attend.  We will have 
several large tables set up and would like to have at least 1 Enron 
representative at each table to facilitate conversation.  

The group will depart from Houston by approximately 3:45 to head for College 
Station for the BIG GAME!!!!!

Thank you in advance for your help.  Please don't hesitate to call if you 
have any questions.

2010-02-08,(No Subject),"To whom it may concern:

In previous years Enron has sponsored athletic tournaments for it's 
employees.  I have participated in tournaments ranging from softball to flag 
football.  In addition, Enron has been very invloved with charitable 
organizations in the community.  With these two things in mind, I wanted to 
propose a flag football tournament to benefit a charitable organiztion.  I 
know that some of the budgets for sports clubs have been reduced (including 
flag football) recently.  This is a way that Enron can support employee 
interaction and wellness and, at the same time, give back to the community.

My questions are : Is this idea plausible?  If so, who should I contact with 
regards to setting up the tournament?


Thanks in advance,


Eric Bass

I had a pretty good weekend.  I got to see my extended family in Fairfield.  
Did you ever meet my cousin Chuck and his wife Shelley?  They have the cutest 
kids (Becca and Cullen).  So, I spent a lot of time with them.  I had fun at 
your birthday party!  When do I get to take you to PF's for lunch?

promotion memo from Energy Operations.  I believe that they both work under 
Peggy Hedstrom in operational roles.  I am sure that they didn't mind having 
their names included twice in promotional memos!  

Peggy says that you and Juanita are headed to Calgary next week, and she 
wondered if I would be coming.  I will be in South America in what should be 
summer there.  I do plan to make a trip to Calgary soon.  In addition to 
other things that Peggy and I have to cover, I plan to host a happy hour in 
Calgary to honor Peggy's promotion and Diane and Melinda, also.  I hosted a 
happy hour in Houston for Energy Operations employees who were promoted last 
week, and I wanted to do the same thing for the three in Calgary.

time for just the two of us to get together.  

We are continuing the worldwide operations/controls review at the request of

Operational Risk Management was the topic of an information session held last 
week for all managers, directors, senior directors and vice presidents in ENW 
supporting trading operations for EA, EIM and EGM in Houston, Portland and 
Calgary.  Operations professionals who manage risk book reporting and 
anaylsis, confirmations, physical product scheduling and cash management 
reaffirmed their roles in effectively accessing, managing and mitigating 
operational risk.  This focus on operational risk management  will ensure the 
quality of EWS' earnings and support a platform for continuing growth across 
all commodities in 2001.

2010-09-05,End of Season,"Eric,

Thanks for running the league.  It was fun.  And
thanks for selecting Boumann as your QB in the first
round of the playoffs.  And tell P-Love that I
appreciated him leaving Warner for me at the 7th pick
in the draft.

Anyway, since I no longer work in the Enron building,
it would probably be easiest to drop a check in the
mail:

Reagan Mathews
17210 Canyon Stream Ct.
Houston, TX  77095

By my calculation the amount should be:
$608.5

(1614-840) x 75% = 580.5 + $28 = $608.5.

$28 comes from...my total costs of -132, plus my paid
amount of 120, plus my winnings of 40. 

The reason I bring this up is that it looks like the
""Finances"" page of the website is double counting the
$50 entry fee.  Anyway, let me know if you have a
different number for the distributions.

-Reagan

2010-04-26,RAC risk reporting,"Currently, members of Ted Murphy's group have been preparing certain 
non-standard reports at the request of commercial.  These reports can be 
categorized as:

""morning report"" - daily
Component V@R - daily
Adhoc V@R - as needed
Book reconciliation - as needed
Stress testing - as needed
Back testing - weekly
Correlation Matrix - bi-weekly


I have obtained a copy of all reports currently being prepared.  In the 
upcoming weeks we need to transfer the preparation of these reports from RAC 
to Risk Operations.  In order to do that, on a report by report basis, we 
need to determine what group within Risk Operations should prepare these 
reports (Risk Management and Controls or the individual commodity risk 
management groups).

In the next couple days,  I will be sending you each a listing of reports 
prepared, and then set up a time to meet with you so we can determine the 
best way to go forward.

I gave this presentation to John Sherriff, Richard Lewis and Joe Gold this 
afternoon - lots of interesting feedback !

Would love to take you through this  - I also took Joel Henenberg through an 
early draft version and suggested we should discuss it on a call with 
yourself and Mary next week.

There are some significant issues arise around Thunderball and Global Markets 
which we have started to discuss with Kevin Swenney and Cindy Horn ( I missed 
my opportunity to take Brent through all the issues this afternoon but will 
try to get to him soon ).

Hope all is well - speak to you soon

Mike

2010-05-20,Re: reminder -pira dinner sund may 13 th 7.45 pm st regis,"i think the velocity of the down move will be much less severe from here.  
still dont think this is equilibrium.  need to see aga coming in lower than 
expectations for a couple weeks signaling that we've moved down the demand 
curve.  think a lot of spec shorts are looking to take profits as we get 
close to the psychological 400 target.  market needs producer selling to get 
us through there.  have seen some as williams is starting to hedge barrett : 
hence the weakness in the back of the curve recently.  still going lower but 
it will be a tougher move from here.

2011-05-25,trading in India,"By way of introduction, I am the director of global risk operations reporting 
to Sally Beck.  One of my responsibilities is to help new Enron offices set 
up risk control functions.  I have been speaking with Milind Laad and Heidi 
Hellman, located in India, concerning the marketing and origination of coal, 
liquid fuels, gas and power transacted by the Indian office.

I was wondering what your understanding of the Indian office's 
trading/marketing/origination plans are as coal and liquids and what type of 
trading authorizations you have given them to date.  I understand that any 
coal deals done by India will be included in George's book and any liquids 
deals done will be included in John's book.

Thanks,

2010-01-14,CAISO Notice: August 31 Distributed Generation Meeting,"To Market Participants:

At the Market Issues Forum yesterday, Jeanne Sole led the presentation on
Distributed Generation, presenting the initial ISO thinking based on recent
proceedings and feedback from participants.   In the context of the CPUC
proceeding on distributed generation, the ISO has identified ISO
requirements that should be clarified or revised to accommodate distributed
generation.    The ISO has scheduled a meeting on August 31 , in Folsom,
from 10:30 AM -3 PM  to discuss its initial ideas on
clarifications/revisions. The ISO invites entities interested in discussing
these ideas and other ideas related to distributed generation to attend.  It
is our schedule now to take this issue to the Governing Board in October.

The ISO will distribute information on its initial ideas along with more
information on the location of the meeting by Friday August 18.

This is the feedback from Sheri Thomas' direct reports.   It is well written 
and constructive.   I told Dale that I would forward it to you and that I was 
sure that you would appreciate the feedback.

I want to thank you for passing my Resume to the appropriate person there. I will have a job interview tomorrow with Lydia Delgado (Human Resources) and Marc Dana Davis (not sure what department since Miss Delgado just mention ""Trading"").
I also want to take this opportunity to let you know that another friend of mine is looking into Enron, and I mention him that you could have a position open in your area. He has worked with us for 2-3 years now, and I fully recommend him.
I will ask him to send you a copy of his resume, and I hope that you can help. 
I want to thank you again for your help.

2011-03-17,(No Subject),"Hi Don,

Just wanted to get this out to you in the hope that you havent worked on January's and this month's schedule. I had already planned to be in Denver to ski (know any good resorts?) and then spend the new year with my family..earlier the plan was to do this from the26th onwards..as scheduled, but since we might not get our vacation from Enron at all.. I was wondering if everything being exegient, I could take off a little early and arrive into say the 4th or so of Jan?

This of course being that I dont upset too many other schedules and no news occurs upon us which would preclude this.

Also on an unrelated note..the people from Trader News called and wanted prices,...but I have not sent them anything not knowing our legal position on the same.


See you in a bit.

2010-09-17,Status on Hiring,"Hi Don,

  I was just following up to my last email regarding the status of job opportunities in your group.  I had a death in the family and was out last week.  I know you guys are probably coming up on bidweek now and have very little time to interview.  I would really like a one on one with you to discuss opportunities as soon as you can  make some time available.  As I mentioned before, having had the opportunity to go up and observe the guys helped tremendously.  Thank you again for that.  This is exactly  what I want to do.  I hate to come out sounding like a pest, but, I am eager to start.   I want to work the night shift and get back into the fasted paced environment.  Thank you for your time, Don, hoping to hear from you soon.  

Sincerely,

Zarin Imam

2011-07-30,Data Integrity,"Andrea,

I am supposed to follow up and work on our action plan for data integrity.  
However, I know that you are going to meet with David/Robert on the whole 
concept and that you proposed a work around for the near term after our 
sessions.  It appears as if our action plans will depend on the results of 
that meeting.  

I will be out of the office on Wed-Friday on business.  It looks like our 
action plan revisions are due on Friday (but, if necessary, I'll ask for an 
extension because of my travel).  In the meantime, you can meet with 
David/Robert and begin to look at revamping our prior efforts.

Alternatively, you can reconvene the group and work on revising action plans 
without me.  (I am not sure how helpful I am in any event).  What do you 
think?

 Employees","Attached please find information which has been sent to active and inactive deferral plan participants regarding the status of their deferred compensation accounts.   The information consists of a letter which provides details of account balance(s) by plan, life-to-date contributions under most plans, general Q&A's regarding top hat non-qualified deferral plans, the process for preserving a claim with the bankruptcy court and a sample claim form.  We have received many calls and think that this will answer most questions.  Any additional questions regarding deferrals may be forwarded to executive.compensation@enron.com, voice mail 713-345-7960, or to P. O. Box 1188 in care of the Deferral Plan Administration group for a written response.  

We will continue to work with Weil, Gotshal, and Manges LLP to exhaust any reasonable effort as it relates to making payments to the participants of Enron's deferral plans.  

If you have questions, please call me at x35816.

2011-01-31,Order re. transfer of operational control to MISO,"On July 27, 2001, the Commission approved the application of Minnesota Power and Superior Water, Light and Power Company to transfer operational control of certain jurisdictional transmission facilities to the Midwest ISO when it becomes operational.  The approval was conditioned on Great River (MP's only network transmission customer) reaching agreement MP on how Great River's facilities will be operated by the ISO.  

With regard to the Midwest RTO, the Commission stated its approval of the transfer of operational control does not constitute a finding regarding the scope of an RTO for the Midwest.

2011-04-25,[cheatsheets] Bad News - Ricky Williams,"In case you haven't heard, New Orleans Saints RB  Ricky Williams suffered a 
broken ankle today and is expected to miss 6-8 weeks  which for most Fantasy 
GMs means he's done for the year.
?
Chat Morton is the rookie from USC who filled in  for Williams. But he's 
short (5' 8"" and light 187#)? and I don't think this  is a situation like 
Denver where the backup RB will step in and perform almost  as well as the 
starter.? 
?
Just wanted to give you a headsup as I know many  leagues have a first come 
first serve policy for distributing free  agents.

More Monday.

Thursday morning during my commute?  I will be out of the office Friday, 
March 2 and Monday, March 5.  I will be a chaperone for my daughter's high 
school drill team to state competition in Dallas - really a Texas 
experience!  A great time to support her and be around her friends.   And 
nicely enough, she asked me to be a chaperone.  With 81 girls on the team, it 
will be loud, but fun.  --Sally

2010-08-09,Missed our Timing,"I didn't get back from the meeting with Causey and Buy until just before 6:00 
today - not that the meeting was long - Rick Causey was just running late so 
we cooled our heels outside his office for quite a while before getting 
started.  I decided that midnight would be outside the bounds of office 
dedication, so I did not call!  Enjoy your time off tomorrow and on Monday.  
My plans are to take off next week, and to be back in the office to work the 
week between Christmas and New Years.  I wouldn't recommend taking your time 
during your day off to call, but if you finish your Christmas shopping and do 
want to call, my calendar is free all afternoon after lunch tomorrow.  Wish I 
could send you with a shopping list for me!!

set a deadline of November 10th to have a plan on all North American projects 
(I'm ok if fundementals groups are excluded) that is signed off on by 
commercial, Sally's world, and Beth's world.  When I say signed off I mean 
that I want signitures on a piece of paper that everyone is onside with the 
plan for each project.  If you don't agree don't sign. If certain projects 
(ie. the gas plan) are not done yet then lay out a timeframe that the plan 
will be complete.  I want much more in the way of specifics about objectives 
and timeframe.

Thanks for everyone's hard work on this.

I got a Bed and Breakfast for Friday Night with one King Size Bed.  It will 
be nice and cozy for the six of us.

Just kidding - this is a pretty nice place - we have 2 dbls and the hotel is 
in between the stadium and 6th street.  (11th street).

the rate is $145.  the tickets are $30 - so - $54/person for everything.

we will leave at 4 on Friday if that is ok with everyone.",don.baughman@enron.com,0.0031179881,0.08143438,0.9154476,positive,2011-09-12/2011-09-18,0.9123296119000001,0.19613996368790265,0.43708351563333325,0.442876917086342,0.298702509326275,-1.5000000000000004,0.345944779828189,0.07649356318000003,0.5881707063669432,0.3632546906538911,-1.1858678506186877,0.30721860480787616,0.2350199574142857,0.5542730417473649,-0.2807911345502921,-1.337397647241978,0.2228564477917144,0.23637981389,0.47207673930380684,-0.32479076039954957,-0.9581094558941592,0.1554196264954715,0.19298008424333332,0.39423295967672656,0.05069435315493314,-0.4973867999010486,2011-09-18,6,6,1,0.36300197500000003,0.03591896,-0.554698725,2011-09,1

you and Frank will be in Spain on Monday night.  Beth and I plan to have 
dinner that night.  Will you be back in town later in the week?  I have 
business plans for dinner on Tuesday and Thursday.  Could you make dinner on 
Wednesday night (the 17th)?  There is an Enron happy hour for Beth that I 
will stop by at 6:30 that night, but I expect to be free after that.

accomplishments.   You should find that when you return to the office.  Let 
me know if for some reason you do not have that copy, and I will have another

Have a happy new year!  I will be at the Cotton Bowl watching Meagan's drill 
team perform - and also watching some of the game.  Thankfully, no emotional 
attachment to either team in that game!  I just hope that we don't freeze.

2010-09-21,Re: Dec99 Enron North America Wholesale Volumes,"Thanks for your help.

There really are no material changes for Texas.  The only issue that I see is 
the month to month change in volumes between December and November 99.  This 
was due primarily to slightly cooler temperatures (Entex takes were slightly 
higher) and an extra day of flow (31 vs. 30).  Let me know if you have 
further questions.


Thanks,

Eric

Not much is going on over here, just gutting it out until the weekend.  It

we can hand out to the different departments at
Enron.  Whenever you get the chance if you could send over the names and
titles of the different departments it would really help.  I will be back in

Here's an agenda for Monday's OATI Presentation.
We're looking forward to seeing you or someone from your group (3AC 17C1).

(Kevin said):

 I know that some of the people there have seen many of our products so maybe if the
dial-up doesn't perform well we can retreat to a workstation for those that
may be interested in viewing some specific functionality of the products.
Attending from OATI will be Sasan Mokhtari, Manuel Santos, Ken Vormwald, and
myself.

Don and Shannon,

Congratulations to both of you on your engagement from the Snapkas.  We also
would like to welcome you to the Bay Area!  I am sure the neighbors do not
know what they are in for.  We are always looking for someone to drink with.
We can even call it dinner.  I hope things are going well with the
arrangements.  If you invite us over, we would love to pee in your pool.
Take care!

Gerald and Cindy

report who would have to add her to his staff is on vacationing out of town 
until Monday.  I will talk with him on Monday morning and I will have him 
visit with Jeff Sorenson, who previously interviewed Avril (he liked her and 
was favorably impressed, but had no position for her).  We may then want to 
be able to talk with Avril by phone, since a face-to-face interview will not 
be possible.  We should have a decision then very early in the week.  Since 
you will be in Houston I can update you in person.  I would not panic!

2010-06-05,2001 Plan vs 2000 Forecast Explanation,"Sarah,
Below is our high level explanation of the Energy Operations (including EOL) 
increase in 2001 plan over 2000 forecast of $5.1 million.  If you have any 
questions, please let me know.


Energy Operations has experienced a 140% increase in transaction growth as a 
result of EOL activity, requiring additional resources to support this new 
business.  However, resources have only increased at a rate of 11% due to the 
efficient use of existing resources.  As a result the per unit cost of 
supporting individual transactions has decreased significantly in the 100% to 
400%+ range.

The trip was fun but I lost $650.  It wasn't good for the wallet.  Vegas is a 
fun weekend trip but I can't imagine staying longer than that.

How was your weekend?

2010-11-26,Gordon Heaney's Acceptance,"FYI - Beth Apollo led the doorstep review in Monterrey last week.  No 
problems discovered - but Beth did find some communications and system access 
issues that could be improved to make it easier for Max's team to do their 
jobs.  She has quickly identified a point person within Operations in Houston 
who is bi-lingual (Gordon).  Max's note addresses his pleasure over Beth's 
responsiveness and the doorstep process in general.  Just wanted to pass this 
along.  --Sally

Let's look at  their lifestyle: 
No premarital sex. 
No oral sex.  Giving or  receiving.  Never. 
No booze.  None. 
No TV.  No cable TV.  
No Spice channel.  No Playboy channel. 
No Hooters. ""What is this  Hooters of which you speak ?!?"" 
No titty bars. 
No organized sports of  any kind.  That's right-no sports. 
The women have to wear baggy dresses  and veil's.  Women have 
to cover up everything! 
Very, very, very  few cars.  Camels.  Many camels. 
Sand.  Fucking sand  everywhere! 
More sand. 
Ever fish at an oasis? 
Rags for clothes and  hats. 
Bar-B-Q's are cooked over burning camel dung chips. 
Eating with  your right hand only-because you wipe your ass 
with your left hand.  
Constant wailing from the asshole next door ... no wait, 
is that  music?  Shit!  I can't tell. 
Oh, by the way, when you die it all  gets better!

write me a check for $100.  I will pay the $1252.  

You will pay me $100/ month for 13 months ( so you last payment will be made 
to me on October 18th, 2001).
Payments will be due to me on the 18th of every month - NO EXCEPTIONS -  I 
cannot do this deal if you do not pay me on time - I will not make any 
exceptions for you.

Let me know if this is ok with you and I will work up a contract.

2010-08-02,OU Salaries,"Sally,

Just something from a recruiting prospective for us to think about, 
remembering the situation from last fall of George making the mistake of 
extending verbal offers, quoting incorrect salaries, and the difference being 
recovered by your RC, I wanted to bring the potential of a residual OU salary 
issue to your attention.  

The salary being offered for another internship or full-time position, which 
ever applies, may appear (to the OU candidates) to be wrong.  Interns will 
enter the program at the same pay rate, $3,000 monthly and the full-time 
analysts at 40k.  As you know, both salaries are non-negotiable for 
consistency amongst the program participants.  

I'm sure questions will come up regarding compensation and thought we could 
discuss the inevitable.  I would really like your input on how to ""soften the 
blow"".

I look forward to your response.
Thanks

2010-12-31,Now HERE is a good lawsuit...,"A fun-filled bachelor party at a strip club called the Pretty Kitty
turned deadly recently when a 32-year-old groom-to-be who was enjoying
the attentions of a well-endowed stripper suffocated while his face was
buried in her 72-DD breasts. According to investigators, the man was
enjoying a lap dance from a stripper named Kandy Kane when disaster
struck. She began giving him a lap dance, shaking her breasts in his
face. The more she shook, the deeper the man got lost in her cleavage.
Before long, his friends noticed he was no longer moving. The man's
family is suing Miss Kane and the Pretty Kitty for wrongful death.

2010-12-04,"Duke Purchase for tomorrow, April 26th","I have purchased from Duke   100 mw's at $51  for flow into Entergy (see 
deal#591863) .       Duke is  transmitting this power through their capacity 
through SOCO.     In the event of TLR's,   we have the option of cutting this 
supply,   without booking out (deal was negotiated with Amar).
If this happens,  of course  you need to fill the demand side and cut the 
purchase from Duke in enpower - see deal no. above.   The purchases  go in 
the ST SPP book.

Once again,  If RT has to intervene,  please make sure that Enpower is 
balanced with respect to ST SPP.     Also,   let me know immediately if there

After speaking with Reagan in origination, we thought it would be a good idea to evaluate the status of New Transmission Agreements project.

If it pleases all, let's all get together from 10:00 to 10:30 on Tuesday Jan. 29.

2011-10-21,Hourly Trading,"Hello Don,

I am trying to get a job in the 24 hour trading group.  I was speaking with John Zurita and he said that
you would be a good person to contact.  Currently, I am in the Risk Controls Group with EES working 
strictly with Power deals.  I have been running a small group for the past year called the Contract Post-Pricing Group.  
In addition, I have experience in the Power Underwriting Group and have exposure to various pricing 
strategies, concepts and products.  

I have attached my resume that will give you more detail about my work experience.

I will give you a call later today. 

Sincerely, 

Joe Capasso

In an effort to protect Enron's e-mail system from harmful viruses, the Global Messaging Team has implemented an inbound and outbound cluster of MAILSweeper servers. What does that mean to you, the user? All inbound and outbound Internet mail is passed through a set of servers that will scan each message for viruses, malicious code, business related-content and inappropriate content. Inbound Internet mail that contains the following attachment types will be quarantined (held for delivery): *.vbs, *.exe, *.com, *.bat, *.cmd.

To follow up on our earlier meeting, attached are the following documents for CG&E:

	- TSA network handbook which summarizes all requirements
	- Request for Network Transmission Service (Network Application)
	- Request to designate a New Network Resource (only required when we are ready to designate a resource)
	- OATT Tariff Attachments that includes Attachment F, Network Service Agreement and Attachment G, Network Operating Agreement
	- CG&E TSA, Transmission Scheduling Agent Agreement

If EPMI does not already have the Network Transmission Agreements in place, then CG&E indicated that the process was to first fill out the Network Application and then they will send the Network Service Agreement and the Network Operating Agreement.  

My contacts at CG&E have been Paul Jett  (513) 287-1770 and Steve Averbeck (513) 287-2876.  The government affairs contact is Gloria Ogenyi x 58202.  

Thanks,

organizations in the community.  With these two things in mind, I wanted to 
propose a flag football tournament to benefit a charitable organiztion.  I 
know that some of the budgets for sports clubs have been reduced (including 
flag football) recently.  This is a way that Enron can support employee 
interaction and wellness and, at the same time, give back to the community.

My questions are : Is this idea plausible?  If so, who should I contact with 
regards to setting up the tournament?


Thanks in advance,


Eric Bass

still trying to eliminate some pages to make it more a more manageable size.

made that into an appendix - nice work, but way too much detail for a

2010-04-20,Re: Hi,"Hey Mom,

Things are well.  Just looking forward to the weekend.  We are going to Happy 
Hour tonight to celebrate Tim's engagement.  Shanna is going to visit Toni 
tomorrow, apparently she has taken a turn for the worse.  Other than that, 
just trying to get back into the work groove after all of that vacation.  

How are things on the homefront?

if you don't like that is fine but it still doesn't change the fact that you 
have a shaky second rb and no backups that start let alone play.

2010-02-22,Kirit Purbhoo Resume,"Hi Don,

Attached please find my resume for your review.  I liked to thank you for allowing me to sit with the shift guys for the past few nights.  The exposure has been invaluable.  I worked closely with Joe Errigo, who has been extremely helpful in showing me the routine of the job.  I received some hands on training with some of the work that is expected from the shift crew.  In particular, checkouts, price discovery, identifying constraint paths, input deals into the P&L  and Enpower.  

The demanding and fast paced nature of this position is exactly what appeals to me.  My past experience with trading and scheduling should provide a good base.  I would like to sit down with you and discuss opportunities within your group.  Again, thank you for the opportunity, hope to hear from you soon.   


		 


Thanks,

2010-05-05,Doorstep personnel from London,"Dear Mike,

Thank you for volunteering some of your leads to work with us on the upcoming 
Doorstep reviews.  I have spoken with Sally and we think that in principle it 
is a good idea to get your people involved on a world-wide basis - the more 
resources we can use the better!

I have put together a schedule for Q4 00 - Q4 01 and would like to receive 
proposed names from you allocated to individual doorstep reviews. 

Attached is the latest draft of the Doorstep schedule.  Please let me know by 
next Tuesday if there are Risk Operations spots you may be able to fill (any 
with whom).  Also, as you are responsible for ensuring that the Enron Europe 
(with the exception of London) doorsteps are performed, please let me know 
which individuals you plan to allocate to these reviews.

Thanks,

Shona

2010-07-23,ERMS Resources,"I heard today that Curtis Smith has resigned.  I am sure that both ot you 
know that Curtis and Jeremy Wong were viewed by users as critical resources 
for ERMS support.  Even at a stand still, my team had great concern over the 
rumored loss of Curtis and/or Jeremy.  And with the assumption that Sitara 
will not go forward for valuation, then ERMS really has become repositioned 
as one of our key, strategic systems.  There is much to do to ""catch up"", if 
you will, with changes and enhancements that were put on hold for several 
years during the Sitara development stage.  And our business continues to 
grow and change rapidly, requiring responsive enhancements on an on-going 
basis.   

I would like to get together to discuss the staffing plan for support of ERMS 
as soon as possible.   We need to understand how day-to-day production 
support will be managed and how development work will be effectively 
handled.  

I will ask my assistant to set up a meeting as soon as possible.

2010-02-07,Enron Japan Trading,"Hi,  How is everyone doing?  Busy , Busy, Busy I know.

I am currently in the middle of selecting our Japan Banking Relationship and 
several questions have come up.

It is important that I understand how your trading settlements will work.

I have spoken to Louise Kitchen about Enron Online and where it fits in with 
our banking.  Enron Online does not interface with the banking.  It 
interfaces with a trading system/accounting system?  What I need to know is 
what system is planned for Enron Japan's accounting for the trading.  The 
accounting system you use will interface with our Treasury system.

What it boils down to, is the payment format that we will use to make local 
Japanese payments may need special programming to meet the needs of the 
Japanese  - English translation. The accounting system used will need to 
interface with our Treasury software to process the settlements, we will need 
to interface with the bank.  

  Please advise.

Thank you,

I know how it is and do not want to armchair quarterback but we need explanations of why this happens and I don't see any in the services comment section.  It is imperative that we keep notes and try our best not to be more than 2 mgw's off either way.  that is 2 minus the bandwith allotment.

I got your e-mail yesterday.  Shanna wasn't offended by your poignant 
political comments, she just knows, in no uncerain terms, that your are 
Republican and are going to vote for Bush.  

Disregard the bills that your recieve from Blockbuster.  I will pay the late 
fee the next time I rent a movie.

How are things otherwise?

2011-08-03,Status on Hiring,"Hi Don,

  I was just following up to my last email regarding the status of job opportunities in your group.  I had a death in the family and was out last week.  I know you guys are probably coming up on bidweek now and have very little time to interview.  I would really like a one on one with you to discuss opportunities as soon as you can  make some time available.  As I mentioned before, having had the opportunity to go up and observe the guys helped tremendously.  Thank you again for that.  This is exactly  what I want to do.  I hate to come out sounding like a pest, but, I am eager to start.   I want to work the night shift and get back into the fasted paced environment.  Thank you for your time, Don, hoping to hear from you soon.  

Sincerely,

Zarin Imam

2010-08-28,Houston visit,"Hi Sally,

I am so excited to see you and your family.  For your written
records...we'll in be Austin from Oct 27- Oct 31.  Then, we'll travel to
Houston via the Blue Bell ice cream factory on Nov 1st -- our plane leaves
from Houston on Sat, Nov 4th about 12:30.  Doing something on Friday with
Rebecca and Tyler sounds great -- she's pretty much up for anything.

Let me know what you hear from Mo -- it would be wonderful to see her, too.
Paul and I were starting to worry that something bad had happened in her
life!  It has been so long since we have talked to her.

This week's issue of Business Week has Enron in a list of the top 50
companies who are making the Internet work for them in running their
business  -- the focus for Enron was on the different trading operations,
highlighting trading broadband capacity.  I read BW weekly and Enron seems
to be in there a lot.

Take Care,

2010-04-28,EIM Resources,"Thanks for the call.  Brenda Herod is the operations controller for EIM. 
(Brenda and Brent in their roles over EIM and EGM, respectively, are both 
direct reports of mine.)  Brenda is out of the country through the end of 
this week on vacation, touring Europe with her mom.  If there is a need to 
address this issue this week, let me know and I can start down that road 
until Brenda returns.  Let me know. 

I did hear an unsubstantiated rumor this week that Clickpaper.com is set to 
go live in London within 5 days.  I am trying to find out if that is true.   
If it is, it would be a repeat of a commercial decision in Houston to do so 
this past July without letting anyone in the mid and back office know.  We 
had to scramble to set up an infrastructure to support that in a big hurry.  
Not ideal.  I hope that history has not repeated itself.  Let me know if you 
have heard anything on this.

After speaking with Reagan in origination, we thought it would be a good idea to evaluate the status of New Transmission Agreements project.

If it pleases all, let's all get together from 10:00 to 10:30 on Tuesday Jan. 29.

If you have any questions or timing conflicts give me a shout.

2011-10-23,James is coming...,"In my new role as social secretary for James, I wanted to let you know that 
he will be in London next week on business.  He will arrive on Monday morning 
(February 5) and should be in the Enron office  most of the day on Monday, 
Tuesday and Wednesday.  He will fly back to Houston on Thursday.  He has 
dinner plans for Wednesday evening, but would love to get together with you 
for dinner on Monday or Tuesday, if you are in town and available.  He will 
be staying at the Sheraton Belgravia Hotel - walking distance to Enron 
House.  Best way to contact him at Enron's London office would be through 
Mike Jordan or his assistant.  Mike's number (don't know how many of these

2011-11-03,Fundamental Operating Standards,"Attached for your review are the fundamental operating standards and controls 
that have been developed by the Wholesale Services group.  These standards 
are to be met by all Enron offices and by each functional group within the 
operations process.  Qualitative standards should be viewed as the basic 
measures to be taken when opening a new office or trading a new commodity.  
Statistics measuring compliance with quantitative standards will be monitored 
on a daily basis and any issues that arise will be addressed immediately.

As business unit heads, you play a critical role in working with Operations 
to ensure that proper controls are in place and working effectively.  Please 
review this document and let me know if you have any questions or wish to 
discuss further.

There is a chance that she could be added to two other home games if 
alternates are needed.  Nothing definitive on that, of course.  She did get 
put into a routine last year as an alternate, but you never know.  

We would love for you to come for a visit this fall, and it would be fun if 
it would work around one of these games.  I have also given this schedule to

2010-09-05,Hourly Trading,"Hello Don,

I am trying to get a job in the 24 hour trading group.  I was speaking with John Zurita and he said that
you would be a good person to contact.  Currently, I am in the Risk Controls Group with EES working 
strictly with Power deals.  I have been running a small group for the past year called the Contract Post-Pricing Group.  
In addition, I have experience in the Power Underwriting Group and have exposure to various pricing 
strategies, concepts and products.  

I have attached my resume that will give you more detail about my work experience.

I will give you a call later today. 

Sincerely, 

Joe Capasso

2011-03-20,Power Trader Position,"I saw a job posting for a Power Trader (24-Hr real time) in the Enron intranet and I was wandering if we could meet to discuss further. 

I have been with Enron for about a year doing power origination and trading in Latin America. I recently moved back to the US and have been working with EES for a couple of months. Before Enron I worked a few years in PSEG trading and Constellation Power Source, but not as a trader. I know the northeast (PJM mainly) power markets (24 hour) fairly well. I have always been interested in getting into the trading business and that's why this position caught my attention.

I hope you feel there may be a potential match here. If you think so, please let me know and I can forward you my resume.

Thank you

Ignacio

2010-08-07,Next Day Checkouts with AEP,"Don,

AEP has informed us over the past couple of nights that they MUST HAVE tag numbers in order to do next day checkouts.  They claim that this has always been the case but we know that in the past we have not needed the tag #'s in order to check out. It appears AEP enjoys being difficult.  So it looks like going forward we will need tag numbers from the schedulers in order to check our properly with AEP.

1. We have a new solution for the db which will work in outlook.  They wanted to know if we will still need the historical data and they will need to check if we are allowed to take that data.  Do we need the data?  Do we still have business from that when we become UBS? 

2. Please put in an erequest for a public folder.  Goto erequest and choose applications/ms outlook/public folder...put notes that you will use to replace old ""east power trading"" ln db.



Let me know so I can get it done.

2010-06-16,Disbanding of Joel Henenberg's Team,"I have a stretch goal for the operations budget under Enron Americas to 
reduce costs by the end of the year.  To this end, I have recently studied 
possible options for reaching the targeted savings.  To make the best 
decision on this, I have reviewed functions within my team on the basis of 
core versus non-core functions, and the inherent cost versus value 
proposition.

As a result, I made the decision last week to disband Joel Henenberg's team.  
To fulfill the role of Joel and his team in leading IT initiatives, we will 
lean on the appropriate IT project managers and the business sponsors/end 
users.   

Joel and his team were told of this decision on Friday afternoon last week.  
Our HR rep spent some time with the team explaining the corporate

2010-08-30,Update to Bus Pass Information,"
Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as ""taxable"" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as ""imputed tax"". See example below

Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee. 

Subsidy for Bus Pass		$100.00

2011-02-27,Re: Got caught up with real time issue - missed my slot today,"I was probably hopelessly stuck in traffic when we were to talk, and did not 
even realize that the time had passed. Construction on my route in to work is 
to continue until early January, and my alternate routes have proven to 
busts.  

I will call you tomorrow and see if I can catch you between issues.

Thanks for making the trip to Houston with your crew last week.  It was great 
to have people from so many different offices, supporting so many different 
commodities -- and yet with so many similar issues.  Your support for the 
interaction between offices is so valuable.  Thanks again for all of your 
efforts.  --Sally

mws from NSP to AMRN for HE 16, and we received very little help or courtesy 
from the MAPP security center.  This deal cost us $1200 profit (bought $40 
from NSP and sold $52 to AMRN). Three MAPP Fs were submitted showing as the 
POD:  (NSP.AMRN, ALTW.AMRN, MEC.AMRN).    All the requests were returned as 
""refused.""  Ample ATCs were showing on the MAPP web page from NSP to AMRN, 
ALTW to AMRN, MEC to AMRN.  Pat, the file with these ATC printouts are on 
your desk.  No explanation was given as to the reason for the refusal on the 
oasis.  Furthermore, no explanation was given upon calling the MAPP Security 
Center.  In fact, the gentleman at MAPP hung up on us when we called.

2011-05-18,Re:,"We've started breaking out separate P&L's.  It's been a very difficult 
process so far for a number of reasons.  The last processes will be 
separating out the P&L on the executive reports and on VAR. That will happen 
this week.  Meanwhile, the P&L will be retroactive to the start of the year 
and we are going through all the positions such that the total skew is zero 
or an adjustment will be made to get it there.   At the end of the year there 
will be a number next to Maggi's name that he will not dispute.  His 
contribution to the fixed side when I'm on vacations or in meetings will 
continue to be a subjective process.

from NSP and sold $52 to AMRN). Three MAPP Fs were submitted showing as the 
POD:  (NSP.AMRN, ALTW.AMRN, MEC.AMRN).    All the requests were returned as 
""refused.""  Ample ATCs were showing on the MAPP web page from NSP to AMRN, 
ALTW to AMRN, MEC to AMRN.  Pat, the file with these ATC printouts are on 
your desk.  No explanation was given as to the reason for the refusal on the 
oasis.  Furthermore, no explanation was given upon calling the MAPP Security 
Center.  In fact, the gentleman at MAPP hung up on us when we called.

I got a call from another Hourly Trading floor that uses Enron online and is
looking to do some hourly deals at Cinergy.
He said he has not seen anything for over a month.  Do you think you guys
will put the TNE numbers back up, or if they are where should he be looking.

How was Vegas?

2010-08-09,Sending hourly indexes,"I'm sorry for whatever is causing the difficulty for the night desk sending
us the hourly trades that day. I realize how frustrating it must be to take
the time to send it only to hear it did not show up for some reason.

Attached is a template, which includes 5 hubs: AEP, Cinergy, Entergy/SPP,
ComEd, and TVA. The last 2 are next on our list for expansion, and our plan
is to start them at some point during this first quarter. Please include any
hourly deals for these hubs, too, if you have any. The template can then be
emailed to tradersnewsindexes@ipgdirect.com and a link to that email address
is in the template for your convenience.

Thank you again for all your time, and please let me know if there is
something I can do to help you all.

2011-06-22,Re: FW: LNG Weekly Update,"Looks good.  certainly an area we need more focus on.  Obviously the most 
important aspect of lng is how much gas is coming in, what is that relative 
to last year, and what new capacity is coming longer term.  
As an aside, nat gas trades as a funciton of the storage spread to last year 
and five year averages.  It would be very useful if all fundamental analysis 
were geared the same way.  The fact that lng shipments are x this week is 
meaningless.  the fact that they are y delta of last year is extremely 
useful.  if you noticed in the fundies meeting, i was trying to move 
discussion that way.  what's switching vis a vis last year.   whats 
production relative to last year.  it simplifies the fundamental analysis.

Joe is a guy you definitely want to consider.  In fact, we wanted to bring him into our group, but we are in a hiring freeze and with the changes occurring in our group we don't know when we would be able to bring him in.  Anyway, just wanted to give you some feedback.  Hope you didn't get drowned out this weekend!!

Take care,

2011-03-02,summary status of the comments,"Dear Sally,

Attached is the latest version of the summary.  It is complete, but I'm still 
waiting for Scott E to let me know if anything has been done in Panama.

You mentioned yesterday that you wanted the offices rated.  I have put a 
rating in, based on the number comments, size of the office, and severity of 
the comments, and what I understand the general attitude of the office to be, 
but you should probably take a look at it since you attended some of these 
reviews.

2011-03-31,West Power,"I have spoken with Calger about us going through the West Power contracts with his team next Tuesday through Friday.  They are gathering an extended set of information (including the items on the current matrix) on their top 25 exposures.  The top 25 exposures include the top exposures under Master agreements and in many cases include numerous contracts.  Chris said that the 26th exposure was about $10MM and one would need to get to about the 50th exposure to get below $1MM.  I asked him to forward down whatever they had completed to date so we could get educated and keep a central file.  He is also going to forward a call in number for a conference call tomorrow so we can begin to get educated on the current effort.

Lorraine Becker (ext. 31680) will be handling travel arrangements.  Please forward your credit card # so she can complete the reservations.  
(P.S. Piper is getting verification from Bowen regarding travel expenditures.)

2011-09-27,FINAL DECISION ON ACCRUAL VALUE,"Tom has come to a decision on what to do with the ubiquitous accrual value.  
60% of this value should be credited to Greg's Transport expense on a monthly 
basis.  Tom, in turn, will cover Ed on this portion of the expense.

For example:

Accrual Value comes out to be $300,000 for the month of April.

This means that:

Greg's portion of this value is 60% of $300,000 = $180,000
Tom's portion of this value is 40% of $300,000 = $120,000

Greg's Transport Expense is ($700,000)
So, Tom will cover                      $180,000 of this expense
Greg's adjusted Expense is   ($520,000)

Greg's P&L is net better off by the $180,000 of accrual value
Tom's P&L is net better off by $120,000  of accrual value which had not been 
previously recognized.
Ed's P&L is net unchanged from all of the above.

2011-03-05,MISO Approved for Start Up of Transmission Functions,"Yesterday, FERC gave approval for MISO to begin regional transmission operations on December 15, 2001.  This will include administration of their regional transmission tariff, security coordination, and ""other regional transmission organization functions.""  I expect they are going to function very similarly to the manner in which SPP and MAPP currently operate.  I verified this with Roger Harzy at the MISO, and he confirmed they plan to be operational on Dec. 15th.

I will be at MISO next week Tuesday and Wednesday, and will be working to make sure we are set up to take service under their tariff and fully understand their operations. If you have any specific questions, please send me mail, and I will work to address them while I am visiting.

See the attached Electric Power Daily article for more detail (sidebar, p1).

call center that supports EnronOnline.   There is also a call center for

2010-05-04,*Updated* Nightly Duties and MDEA Load sheets folder,"Hello all,

Attached is an updated sheet regarding what needs to be done at night regarding MDEA and our old nightly duties. 

Also there is now a folder near the MAPP printer (between Dean and Don) that will include all the nightly faxes and load sheets.  The folder will help us keep track of what has been faxed in case EES trans calls complaining.  The load sheets are needed for the daily forecasting expained in the SOP 13 Dean sent out last week. In the folder there are extra copies of the SOP 13 in case you want it as well as GENCO phone numbers in case Allegheny calls. 

Hopefully this will help create some consistency on nights and provide the day people access to the MDEA load sheets.  If you have any questions please give me a ring.

Happy Holidays,

Carrie

Don,

Attached is a detailed list of procedures and ideas on MHEB to send to the hourly crew.  With the end of August, lots of power, especially on-peak, is now available that was previously under contract for the summer.  We should have more opportunities to move this power.  They can call me with any questions.  Thanks.

do not anticipate any pipeline penalties.  On those pipes where the nom type 
is ""Intraday"", there may be some pipeline imbalance created for us to work 
through.  The logistics staff will have a lot of work to do on Thursday 
morning to contact customers asking them to renom on the pipes where our noms

2011-02-05,Re: Facility Fees,"Facility fees should be part of the accrual value that fall's out each month 
( as long as the deals are in the WH portfolio).  This value should not be 
given to Sharp unless he bears the cost of the facilities.  There is a file 
in my folder that has a listing of some of the deals that have facility 
fees.  For further info contact Vance Taylor. (the file is called fac costs)

In addition,  I am forwarding an e-mail sent by George Weissman to me 
regarding accrual value.  He thinks that the Coastal Deal that shows up as a 
huge negative each month should have been restructured in April.  Could you 
check into this and get back to him?

Thanks,

Eric

2011-02-10,Staff Meetings,"Same time, same place -- just not as often!

I would like to maintain management team meetings on Monday afternoons from 
2:30 to 3:30 in EB3014.  My plan is to alternate weeks for ENA and EGM 
meetings.  There are a few direct reports, whose work extends across ENA and 
EGM, who will attend both meetings.  Today was the ENA Management Team 
meeting.  Next Monday, August 28 will be the first meeting with the EGM 
management team.  I will look forward to staying current with each one of you 
and Brent on the growth and challenges of the businesses within Enron Global 
Markets.  

I have asked Patti to cancel one-on-one meetings that we had scheduled on the 
calendar going forward.  Although this new structure changes the direct line 
reporting relationship, I will continue to be very interested in the 
professional development of each of you.  I hope that we can schedule time 
together on an as needed basis.

2011-11-22,2001 Plan vs 2000 Forecast Explanation,"Sarah,
Below is our high level explanation of the Energy Operations (including EOL) 
increase in 2001 plan over 2000 forecast of $5.1 million.  If you have any 
questions, please let me know.


Energy Operations has experienced a 140% increase in transaction growth as a 
result of EOL activity, requiring additional resources to support this new 
business.  However, resources have only increased at a rate of 11% due to the 
efficient use of existing resources.  As a result the per unit cost of 
supporting individual transactions has decreased significantly in the 100% to 
400%+ range.

2011-06-27,Re:,"most bullish thing at this point is moving closer to everyone's
psychological $4 price target and that everybody and their dog is still
short.  next sellers need to be from producer community.  saw a little this
week with williams hedging the barrett transaction but wouldnt say thats
indicative of the rest of the e&p community.  short covering rallies will
get more common here.  velocity of move down has slowed significantly for
good (except maybe in bid week).  my concern is if we go to $4 and people

Where are we staying in Telluride again?  I have been looking at some

2011-06-07,Gordon Heaney's Acceptance,"FYI - Beth Apollo led the doorstep review in Monterrey last week.  No 
problems discovered - but Beth did find some communications and system access 
issues that could be improved to make it easier for Max's team to do their 
jobs.  She has quickly identified a point person within Operations in Houston 
who is bi-lingual (Gordon).  Max's note addresses his pleasure over Beth's 
responsiveness and the doorstep process in general.  Just wanted to pass this 
along.  --Sally

on Wednesday, October 25.  That date does not work for me now.  I need to 
attend a get together for the CommodityLogic team that evening, that was just 
set up today.  As of last week, I am now co-leading CommodityLogic (under 
Enron Networks) along with Tom Gros.  This is in addition to my role within 
ENA.  As a new lead over the group, it is important for me to join the team 
for their team building next Wednesday.  

Let me know whether or not you have enough takers for dinner in Austin next 
week.  If you are short, let me know and I will see what I can do on another 
night that week.  --Sally ",sally.beck@enron.com,0.29845345,0.5628463,0.13870029,neutral,2011-01-03/2011-01-09,-0.15975316,0.02328101470417513,0.00971641133333311,0.1525811741473211,-0.4766927039729439,-1.4999999999999998,0.15730367835136808,0.19349389522,0.3966152775062606,1.197119012931695,-0.07100492514928014,0.12252472825588019,0.21297647791428562,0.3500353242972489,1.0289443413289014,-0.16488510374462217,0.14149673389735318,0.22270239023999996,0.376160516132878,0.9251446605935494,-0.7204569076085501,0.16513069324703739,0.25669169305666667,0.406362760654858,0.45296703813790745,-1.1505197255146806,2011-01-05,1,2,0,0.05272515,0.136177244,0.063360628,2011-01,0

Hi!  How are you doing?  I am back at UT and things are already pretty
hectic.  It seems like a long time ago that I was interning at Enron!

I was writing to see if you have had the chance to speak with Mr.
Skilling about speaking at our conference yet?  We are planning to get
the formal invitation out in the next couple of weeks.

Thanks for your time and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

2010-12-21,Did I miss you?,"Around midnight last night as I was creating our calendar for the week, I ran 
through the incoming calls on caller ID to find the piano teacher's number.  
I think that I saw yours.  Did I miss you sometime this weekend?  With almost 
two teenagers in the house, my personal messages have dropped very far down 
the list in importance.  I an never quite sure that I get messages that 
anyone calls!  Feel free to call me at work, or I can try to catch you during 
my commute tonight again.  

Hope you had a good weekend.  Ours involved homework, shoe shopping and 
continuing the search for new clothes.  Our friend Mo was in town from London 
and had burgers with us on Saturday night.    --Sally ",lydia.delgado@enron.com,0.118285336,0.4673717,0.4143429,neutral,2010-12-20/2010-12-26,0.296057564,0.09466494624024406,-0.02017678666666689,0.30767669109024826,0.10649759997352277,-1.5000000000000002,0.1337109349406508,0.190494613,0.3656650584081706,-0.3861205241958634,-1.2943606702769244,0.09901245870831533,0.2068873930714285,0.3146624520153546,-0.5028460798683556,-0.9190763231718493,0.17912479401221992,0.21143562612999994,0.42323137172499387,-0.008011832882505895,-0.5858508263273321,0.1627030112265894,0.17314883121,0.40336461325528966,0.5196434276348239,-0.5230263494080765,2010-12-21,1,1,0,-0.318514584,-0.038073340000000004,0.586017615,2010-12,0

2010-06-29,Order re. transfer of operational control to MISO,"On July 27, 2001, the Commission approved the application of Minnesota Power and Superior Water, Light and Power Company to transfer operational control of certain jurisdictional transmission facilities to the Midwest ISO when it becomes operational.  The approval was conditioned on Great River (MP's only network transmission customer) reaching agreement MP on how Great River's facilities will be operated by the ISO.  

With regard to the Midwest RTO, the Commission stated its approval of the transfer of operational control does not constitute a finding regarding the scope of an RTO for the Midwest.

Please contact me if you need further information.

2011-07-24,Generation,"I am trying to pull together a report on the future of the gas market in 
Texas.  I was wondering if you have a report that shows new generation coming 
on in the next 3-4 years as well as a report that shows current generation.  
The names of the companies building/owning the facilities is not important.  
The most important data is MW capacity as well as type of generation (i.e., 
natural gas, coal, etc.)

Do you have this information?

Thanks,

Eric

2011-01-20,So long,"Hey y'all,

as most of you would probably know by now, I have chosen to leave Enron to
pursue other opportunities.  It's been a good time (4+ years) with great
experiences both in North/South America and in Europe.

I'd like to use this e-mail to thank everybody for their good work and
friendship.  In particular (in order of appearance): Dung Tran, Jon Doyle,
Dave Ramm, Natalie Halich, Roberto Silveira and Rick Waddell have been great
sources of learning and leadership.

'Other opportunities' means exactly that - not quite sure what the next
adventure will be, but it won't be boring!  I encourage you to reply with
your personal e-mail etc., so that we can keep in touch.

All the best,
Christian

2011-08-29,Dinner with UT Students,"I sent an e:mail message yesterday saying that I could make dinner in Austin 
on Wednesday, October 25.  That date does not work for me now.  I need to 
attend a get together for the CommodityLogic team that evening, that was just 
set up today.  As of last week, I am now co-leading CommodityLogic (under 
Enron Networks) along with Tom Gros.  This is in addition to my role within 
ENA.  As a new lead over the group, it is important for me to join the team 
for their team building next Wednesday.  

Let me know whether or not you have enough takers for dinner in Austin next 
week.  If you are short, let me know and I will see what I can do on another 
night that week.  --Sally ",johnny.palmer@enron.com,0.29845345,0.5628463,0.13870029,neutral,2011-08-29/2011-09-04,-0.15975316,0.008276131980976915,-0.057503014333333706,0.09097324871068921,-0.5436370302980144,-1.5,0.12846421462848234,0.18983942043999996,0.35841904891967213,0.5257640174241022,-1.3240116522478649,0.12050622238388152,0.28304454179999994,0.34714006162337635,0.01779684372098715,-1.5334317702933458,0.1886629467510962,0.14389055945999993,0.434353481338755,-0.6214648013706459,0.09036294263672806,0.18123667217657172,0.21102601939333335,0.4257190061256036,-0.0947529850561232,-0.3290870247154145,2011-08-29,1,0,0,0.014474223000000001,-0.027230105999999997,0.422167287,2011-08,0

2011-10-29,Enron Wholesale Services Legal Department," As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

2010-05-16,Info for Sally Beck Jornada,"Diana,

Here's info you requested.  Per our conversation earlier, please try to 
arrange someone with experience/knowledge of Jornada device for training for 
Sally & me both.  Sally is not very technical & will need to be walked thru.  
If she doesn't learn how to properly use it, she will not use it, if you know 
what I mean.  Any help you can give me in setting up training w/ someone that 
will be able to answer our questions is greatly appreciated.  Please have 
person contact me directly as I keep Sally's calendar.  She will be in 
training all day Thursday & Friday, so Monday would be the soonest she is 
available.

1. Each book adm. now checks his/her own positions that are going into V@R,

2011-11-26,Access to Mary Solmonson's e-mail,"Mary Solmonson, one of my direct reports, has been out of the office since 
March 1, 2001 and it is not readily known when she will return to work.  All 
business related e-mail messages require a prompt response from our business 
unit.  Therefore, I am requesting your assistance in completing the following 
tasks:

1)  Grant the necessary access to me to be able to review the incoming 
e-mails directed to Mary Solmonson since March 1, 2001 through today so that 
I can determine which ones require a business response that I can handle.   
Can these be transferred to my e:mail as a simplified way for me to complete 
this review?

2) Effective immediately, please create an automatic message for Mary's 
e-mail box that states ""I am out of the office.  All e-mails are being 
forwarded to Vanessa Schulte for response.""

3)  Effectively immediately, please route any new incoming e-mail messages to

2011-11-28,Canadian Promotions/Trip,"FYI - I had included Diane Seib and Melinda Whalen (from Calgary) in my 
promotion memo from Energy Operations.  I believe that they both work under 
Peggy Hedstrom in operational roles.  I am sure that they didn't mind having 
their names included twice in promotional memos!  

Peggy says that you and Juanita are headed to Calgary next week, and she 
wondered if I would be coming.  I will be in South America in what should be 
summer there.  I do plan to make a trip to Calgary soon.  In addition to 
other things that Peggy and I have to cover, I plan to host a happy hour in 
Calgary to honor Peggy's promotion and Diane and Melinda, also.  I hosted a 
happy hour in Houston for Energy Operations employees who were promoted last 
week, and I wanted to do the same thing for the three in Calgary.

2010-09-04,Staff Meetings,"Same time, same place -- just not as often!

I would like to maintain management team meetings on Monday afternoons from 
2:30 to 3:30 in EB3014.  My plan is to alternate weeks for ENA and EGM 
meetings.  There are a few direct reports, whose work extends across ENA and 
EGM, who will attend both meetings.  Today was the ENA Management Team 
meeting.  Next Monday, August 28 will be the first meeting with the EGM 
management team.  I will look forward to staying current with each one of you 
and Brent on the growth and challenges of the businesses within Enron Global 
Markets.  

I have asked Patti to cancel one-on-one meetings that we had scheduled on the 
calendar going forward.  Although this new structure changes the direct line 
reporting relationship, I will continue to be very interested in the 
professional development of each of you.  I hope that we can schedule time 
together on an as needed basis.

2010-05-11,process flow for doorstep,"Dear Sally,

I may have already sent this to you.  It is a process flow for how we should 
structure, execute, and follow up findings.  Let me know if you have any 
changes.  I've already given it to Donna, Cassandra, and Lynn Bellinghausen 
as a draft.

Also, just to let you know, the schedule is still being revised.  The latest 
version is with Cassandra.  I'll send you a new copy once they've revised 
it.  It will then goto Lynn's group.

Best regards

Shona

my children during part of their spring break.  We will be in town, so I can 
be reached either at home (281-370=8568) or on my cell phone (713-417-1591).  
I will check voice mail messages during this time period, but probably once 
or twice a day.  

I will be in the London office next week.  I will be in that office from 
about noon on Monday through the end of the day on Thursday.  Patti will have 
a schedule of my appointments while I am there, and she will have an 
international cell phone number that I will have with me throughout the 
trip.  Contact her if you need to speak directly with me.  I will be 
responding to voice mail frequently throughout the week.  I will be 
travelling back to Houston on Friday, March 24 (leaving my hotel in London 
around 1 AM Houston time).

do not anticipate any pipeline penalties.  On those pipes where the nom type 
is ""Intraday"", there may be some pipeline imbalance created for us to work 
through.  The logistics staff will have a lot of work to do on Thursday 
morning to contact customers asking them to renom on the pipes where our noms 
were late.  Overall, these pipelines worked well with us today.

(hopefully I'll have that taken care of in the next week), I do have some
contact info in the meantime.

Work phone #:  011.44.20.7546.2381

Fax #: 011.44.20.7546.4448

Once I get a flat address and telephone number I'll forward that along as

Hopefully if some of you find yourselves in London in the future we will be
able to get together.

2010-08-08,A note on PMA's,"You may notice that 9911 PMA's are $(208,881) or approx 10% to the final 
P&L.  You will also notice that the detail following the majority of the 
adjustments is Unaccounted For Gas.  At the close of business for the 991 
P&L, we saw a gain of approx. $250,000 because of a blowout in UA4.  We 
thought that it would be prudent to top level this amount and use it to 
offset the PMA's we would take as a result of this UA4 blowout.  Therefore, 
the net impact of 9911 PMA's is $41,119 or 2% of last day P&L.

I just wanted to congratulate the team on a great P&L for the month of 
November.

2011-09-27,Happy New Year - No Y2K Fear!,"We are wrapping up several hours in the office and have tested all 
commodities front to back.  We found a few minor issues, primarily reports 
with report dates that were incorrect.  The content and underlying 
calculations in the reports were correct.  These were really just query and 
formatting issues.  All were quick fixes of five minutes or less.  So at this 
point we feel confident about our system situation.  More will unfold with 
counterparties next week, but hopefully all found this as uneventful as have 
we.  

Hope your new year's celebration was fun.  We saw pictures of the London 
festivies on TV as we were cooking our New Year's eve dinner last night at 
home.  

See you soon.

2011-02-05,RE: TradersNews,"Don,
I got a call from another Hourly Trading floor that uses Enron online and is
looking to do some hourly deals at Cinergy.
He said he has not seen anything for over a month.  Do you think you guys
will put the TNE numbers back up, or if they are where should he be looking.

How was Vegas?

2010-12-19,(No Subject),"Don:
In case you haven't arrived by the time I leave I wanted to fill you in on tonight's activities.  
JD explained the MHEB relationship and how we should move there power.  As a result I moved 100MW from MHEB to AECI HE 7 & 8 (tag DPL8643).
Be sure to notice the huge profit I raked in on the deal.  
100 MW was all they could give me (they originally told us 200 but at HE 2 they called to cut that down to only 100)
I put the deal in the services p&l under MHEB but I didn't empower the deal because I didn't know which book to put it in. 
I will be in tonight in case we need to go over this in detail.

Joe is a guy you definitely want to consider.  In fact, we wanted to bring him into our group, but we are in a hiring freeze and with the changes occurring in our group we don't know when we would be able to bring him in.  Anyway, just wanted to give you some feedback.  Hope you didn't get drowned out this weekend!!

Take care,

2011-10-11,Doorstep RAC Direction,"Met today w/ Causey and Sally to discuss Doorstep going forward. Following is 
my goal with this process.  Rick Carson will co-ordinate RAC's efforts in 
this area pulling in other RAC people as required.


- RAC will participate in review to determine which offices will be inspected 
and on what frequency
- RAC will help design and participate as required in inspections
- I will be able to see, through the RAC website, a list of all offices, a 
list of all offices requiring inspection, when an office was inspected, 
findings from that inspection and the follow-up from the findings.
- If follow up is not happening, a ""red flagged"" reminder notice should be 
issued via email. 

This has been a huge effort and we have to have this going forward. This is 
one ball that can not be dropped. 

Let me know your thoughts if any.

2010-11-17,India,"I appreciate the time you took yesterday getting me up to speed as to your 
business and where you are in the process of establishing risk operations.  I 
hope you found our meeting useful as the checklist is meant to serve as an 
overview of points that need to be addressed before any transactions are 
entered into.

I was wondering if a meeting with Carole, Milind, Heidi, and myself has yet 
been scheduled for Friday. At that time, I think we need to lay out a road

2011-07-13,SEPA and schedules,"Hey guys,

I talked to Kayne on Monday about the various contracts we have with MDEA to ensure they continued for 2002.  KOCH, NRG, and SEPA all carry over. However, as Mike confirmed in checkouts, SEPA does NOT flow on weekends or holidays and SEPA puts out the tag without consulting us even though the schedule changes regularly.   Currently there is no SEPA schedule in OATI or the services contract book starting 01/07/2002.   Make sure when we do the next day schedules the SEPA contract matches OATI once SEPA puts out the new tags.

Last month we didn't have to place as close attention when scheduling because SEPA put out a tag for the entire month and Laura matched it in the services book for us. 

And for your reference, the January Entergy OASIS #  for WR to MDEA (30MW all day) is: 1025604 (Daily NN-6).  

Happy New Year!

Carrie

2011-02-22,Hourly Trading Position,"Hi Don,

I know its been a while since my last email or phone call,
but I am still very interested in the position.  
Therefore, I am going to post for the position via Human Resources.
(Just so that I am going through the correct channels.)
I wanted to drop you a quick note before I send it to HR.

I am still interested in sitting on the desk for a couple of 
hours so that I can learn more.  Which day would be best
for a quick visit?

I hope all is well and I hope to speak with you soon.

Sincerely,
Joe Capasso

2010-03-29,Panama City Doorstep,"Dear Lynn,

As it turns out, there is no deal documentation for the Panama City deals in 
Panama (everything is in Houston).  Therefore, the deal test will need to be 
done from Houston and we won't need anyone from your group to attend the 
upcoming doorstep.  Scott and Michelle Bruce will obtain the population when 
then are in Panama and also write the report.

Best regards

2010-03-28,Power Trader Position,"I saw a job posting for a Power Trader (24-Hr real time) in the Enron intranet and I was wandering if we could meet to discuss further. 

I have been with Enron for about a year doing power origination and trading in Latin America. I recently moved back to the US and have been working with EES for a couple of months. Before Enron I worked a few years in PSEG trading and Constellation Power Source, but not as a trader. I know the northeast (PJM mainly) power markets (24 hour) fairly well. I have always been interested in getting into the trading business and that's why this position caught my attention.

I hope you feel there may be a potential match here. If you think so, please let me know and I can forward you my resume.

Thank you

Ignacio

I'm pleased to note that you will once again be my PRC Rep.  Since the time 
we talked a couple of weeks earlier in your office, I have rotated out of the 
Middle East Development Group as of 10/31/00 and joined Larry Lawyer's 
Finance Group in EGM.  I'm really excited about my new rotation.  With 
regards to my work over the last 6 months, I'd be happy to give you a 
personal account of my achievements at a time convenient to you.  Meanwhile, 
should you need any information from my end, pls call me at x-54326.

Thanks for your time yesterday, I will be putting together a press kit that
we can hand out to the different departments at

titles of the different departments it would really help.  I will be back in
contact with you and lets try to set up next Wed. for some drinks after
work.  Have a great time in Vegas and Good Luck.  Tell hair guy hello.

I mostly used the review course books.  You are welcome to borrow them if you 
like.  Otherwise, I am sure that either Kaplan or Princeton Review has some 
good books.  Check the AIMR website.

I will call you tomorrow and see if I can catch you between issues.

Thanks for making the trip to Houston with your crew last week.  It was great 
to have people from so many different offices, supporting so many different 
commodities -- and yet with so many similar issues.  Your support for the 
interaction between offices is so valuable.  Thanks again for all of your 
efforts.  --Sally

Thanks for your time yesterday, I will be putting together a press kit that
we can hand out to the different departments at
Enron.  Whenever you get the chance if you could send over the names and
titles of the different departments it would really help.  I will be back in
contact with you and lets try to set up next Wed. for some drinks after
work.  Have a great time in Vegas and Good Luck.  Tell hair guy hello.

I got a call from another Hourly Trading floor that uses Enron online and is
looking to do some hourly deals at Cinergy.
He said he has not seen anything for over a month.  Do you think you guys
will put the TNE numbers back up, or if they are where should he be looking.

do not anticipate any pipeline penalties.  On those pipes where the nom type 
is ""Intraday"", there may be some pipeline imbalance created for us to work 
through.  The logistics staff will have a lot of work to do on Thursday 
morning to contact customers asking them to renom on the pipes where our noms 
were late.  Overall, these pipelines worked well with us today.

2011-12-28,Fall APDA Conference,"Matt, Don, and Doug,

As you all probably know by now, the Fall APDA Conference will be held in Watertown, South Dakota from September 20-23.   WAPA is hosting the conference this fall and they have created a website:  www.geocities.com/apdaconferences.

The website contains agenda information, reservation materials, contacts, etc.  Please review and pass on to anyone I may have missed.  Don...I wasn't sure who you would want from your group to go, so please feel free to forward to your guys (the majority of people who attend this conference are hourly/daily traders).

Let me know if you have any questions.

2010-08-06,VP PRC,"The Enron-wide PRC meeting to review the mid-year performance for all Vice 
Presidents has been rescheduled several times.  Currently, this meeting is 
set for September 11 and 12.  Per David Oxley, performance reviews for Vice 
Presidents should be conducted after this PRC process is completed.  Assuming 
that the meeting takes place as now planned in September, I will schedule 
your reviews sometime after September 12.  (Bob, I will assume that your 
review will be given by Rock, but I will keep you informed on this process 
along with Peggy and Brent.)

On another note, Enron hosts an annual management conference each year for 
Vice President level and above.  You should all receive invitations to this 
event.  In recent years, it has been held in San Antonio.  I do not know the 
location for this year, but I do have the dates for you to hold on your 
calendars:  November 15-17.

 Thanks for the research report on EOG.  Here are my observations:

  Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year
  
  Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf

  Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising. 

   Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices:
  (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS 
X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share


 That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices.  I think 
crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share.

 Current price 37
 Nat. Gas 34
 Crude  10

 Total  81

 
 Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate?  To me this 
looks like the best stock to own Also can you send me a report on Calpine, 
Tosco, and SLB?


Thank you,

 Phillip

2011-11-01,"Thanks for January 1, 2000","I wanted to extend my thanks in advance to all of you who will join me in the 
office on January 1, 2000.  I appreciate your willingness to devote part of 
your holiday weekend to the continuing success story at Enron.  

As a company, Enron has spent much time and effort to ensure that business 
will continue smoothly as we move into the year 2000.  Ken Walther, in 
working with many of you, has done an excellent job of preparing a work plan 
for January 1.    Your  work on the first  will be the final step in this 
process.  Your efforts that day will allow all ENA employees to return to the 
office on January 4th with confidence in our ability to continue business as 
usual.

2010-06-13,Power Trader Position,"I saw a job posting for a Power Trader (24-Hr real time) in the Enron 
intranet and I was wandering if we could meet to discuss further. 

I have been with Enron for about a year doing power origination and trading 
in Latin America. I recently moved back to the US and have been working with 
EES for a couple of months. Before Enron I worked a few years in PSEG trading 
and Constellation Power Source, but not as a trader. I know the northeast 
(PJM mainly) power markets (24 hour) fairly well. I have always been 
interested in getting into the trading business and that's why this position 
caught my attention.

I hope you feel there may be a potential match here. If you think so, please 
let me know and I can forward you my resume.

Thank you

Ignacio

Not much is going on over here, just gutting it out until the weekend.  It 
seems like the weeks get longer and longer, doesn't it?

How are things in your world?
You can come by whenever you want to get the check.  How much do I owe you 
again?

2010-05-01,PRC Summary Report,"In an effort to be more proactive, we have contacted each supervisor, whose 
employee received a ""needs improvement"" ranking. We have recommended that the 
supervisor do the following:

Assess the employee's performance
Determine if the employee has improved or still needs improvement
Prepare the necessary background material to present at PRC for 
improved/non-improved employees
Ensure supervisor is able to share specific examples about the improved 
employee (i.e., accomplishments, contributions or positive customer feedback)
Document and contact Human Resources for ""needs improvement"" employees
Address chronic or poor performers immediately; not wait until the PRC Process

I have attached for your review a summary report. The report contains a list 
of ""needs improvement"" employees and their status. Please let me know if you 
have any questions.

2011-11-10,Enron Issues,"Tom (my boss) does not have any documentation with regards to the bonus, but will make an effort to get it when things quiet down.  He did, however, tell me that it is clear to him that this money cannot be touched by Enron because there were discussions in the past few days about trying to get at the money for credit issues and that was not an option available to the company.

What do you think?

However I need a rough estimate of who was in over the week end and the extra hours they put in ect. If you could give me a rough estimate of business that was done during the week end will also help our story.

I will get the forms from Kim and have her review as she is on the committee that review these personnel best requests, so she no's what to put in that will really work.

2011-02-14,Dinner with UT Students,"I sent an e:mail message yesterday saying that I could make dinner in Austin 
on Wednesday, October 25.  That date does not work for me now.  I need to 
attend a get together for the CommodityLogic team that evening, that was just 
set up today.  As of last week, I am now co-leading CommodityLogic (under 
Enron Networks) along with Tom Gros.  This is in addition to my role within 
ENA.  As a new lead over the group, it is important for me to join the team 
for their team building next Wednesday.  

Let me know whether or not you have enough takers for dinner in Austin next 
week.  If you are short, let me know and I will see what I can do on another 
night that week.  --Sally ",kayne.coulter@enron.com,0.29845345,0.5628463,0.13870029,neutral,2011-02-14/2011-02-20,-0.15975316,0.07902382806750441,-0.13836700366666713,0.28111177148512373,0.13895357264666028,-1.5,0.21929465007819798,0.03240968359999989,0.46828906679336213,0.8908312144242242,-0.595128763797296,0.16567814525161775,0.08504152257142836,0.40703580340262174,0.5862875155852906,-0.691814261046948,0.1964614109039098,0.13678455543999996,0.4432396765903407,0.7577247076761836,-0.6763980866634252,0.1294899512102676,0.16054890484000003,0.3598471219980335,0.7759518504843371,-0.12340467795692822,2011-02-14,3,0,0,-0.40817490999999995,0.152827059,0.788772609,2011-02,0

2010-12-04,Message from Rusty,"The following is a message fro Rusty about the grant that the city got to
purchase the land at the back of CCV:

I talked with Peggy this morning. We want to get all the facts and
stipulations laid out for the grant. This will keep any falsehoods from being
spread. We want to encourage all residents to express their feelings, but we
need good facts. It is our intent to get all the facts and try to make this a
positive thing for our residents.

The city has always been very good about working with us and we appreciate it.

Thanks

2011-11-27,Re: Contract,"Gracie,

Based upon my brief review of her comments, many are not acceptable.  Without 
a convincing explanation, I am not going to delete entire sections of our 
agreement, particularly when those sections protect Enron.  Please get with 
her (not by copy of this privileged email) and ask for reasons why she wants 
the changes. 

Thanks.  Michelle

2011-02-26,Hey Man,"
Three interesting things.  
 
1.  The Steer Starletts Fundraiser we think is  going on this Thursday night.  It is a very good Rodeo social  event.  Lots of honies, free drinks and free food.  I will keep you  posted.  I should find out for sure today that it is going on.
 
2.  The Rodeo Kickoff dance is going on next  Wednesday the 16th.  You and Travis are invited to come with me if ya'll  would like.  Or meet me somewhere in the area.  It starts at 7:30 or  something like that.
 
3.  On Friday night some of us are going to  the Firehouse to celebrate Barbara Prukop's 35th birthday.  Ya'll are  invited to that also.
 
So let me know something about joining us for any  of the above social events.

2010-07-15,Re:,"Frank,

The implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position.  Whatever the risk was prior should not matter.  Since the rest of the books are very short price this should be a large offset.  If the VAR calculation does not match the company's true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted.

 Friday, September 15  7:00 pm

 Saturday, October 14  7:00 pm

 Friday, October 20  7:00 pm  (homecoming) 

There is a chance that she could be added to two other home games if 
alternates are needed.  Nothing definitive on that, of course.  She did get 
put into a routine last year as an alternate, but you never know.  

We would love for you to come for a visit this fall, and it would be fun if 
it would work around one of these games.  I have also given this schedule to 
Cindy, as she and Brigeda were interested in making it to a game.  

I am headed to Dallas early tomorrow morning.  Patti has sent you a copy of

The Academy will roll once again!

And by the way plove, it is last day for everyone.  You can take 1 minute out

2011-06-17,Re: Resume,"Thanks for the resume.  She has had some good experience.  Do you know much 
about her performance here at Enron?  Can I call and talk with her directly?  
I would certainly keep the conversation confidential at this point.  --Sally

2011-01-02,(No Subject),"Good to finally hear from.  Judging from your e-mail, it sounds like you had 
some fun in your exercises- I guess that English degree is finally paying off.
Luckily you missed out on another series of disappointments from the Longhorn 
football team.  It seems as though they are improving, however.  Hopefully we 
will be playing for the National Championship next year.  

How are things otherwise?  When are you coming into town again?

Later-

2011-03-11,League is Set,"It looks like we have our 12 teams.  We will probably keep the same rules 
from last year unless anybody has an objection.  Still to be determined are 
league fees, draft date , and free agent pickup protocol.  I suggest that we 
draft on August 27th at the Enron building on floor 26.  For those of you 
that can't make it, you can draft over the internet.  We will be using cbs 
sportsline again - I think that will be $8/person.

Let me know if anyone has a problem with the draft date, i.e. can't make it, 
too early, too late.
If not, THE MEXIMULLETS look forward to a return to Prominence this year.  
You all do not stand a chance!
